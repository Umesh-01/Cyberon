# Overview:

Cyberon is a customisable, friendly, fun discord bot which you can add to our servers and customise it according to your needs.
Cyberon is a bot with mission. This bot is for helping people who are new to hackathons and can't find good ones or are overwhelmed with the number of sites 
they need to search for hackatons. (still in development)

[Installation](#installation) is easy, and you do **NOT** need to know anything about coding! Aside
from installing and updating, every part of the bot can be controlled from within Discord.

**The default set of modules includes and is not limited to:**

- Moderation features (kick/ban/softban, mod-log, multiban, warn, role assignment)
- Fun commands
- Utility commands
- Server configs commands and permissions
- Support commands

# Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/starlightknown/cyberon
sudo pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
or 
```
sudo python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```  
NOTE: Make a .env file and put them in the the same folder as the `bot.py` file, i.e. in the root directory 
and add your tokens as `BOT_TOKEN`, `DATABASE_CLIENT_URL` and `NASA_API_KEY` respectively.
