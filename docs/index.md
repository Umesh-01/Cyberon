Cyberon is a work in progress and we would love to know if you have found any bugs or have any suggestions. Feel free to raise issues on GitHub or use `cyb!bugs "<message>"` and it'll send an embed containing your bug report. 
Note: Your bug should be described in more than 20 words for the bug report to be sent successfully.

You may navigate to the different sections of this documentation using the sidebar on the left, or through the buttons at the bottom of each page. If you are on mobile, the sidebar will be hidden to allow for sufficient reading space for the page content.
