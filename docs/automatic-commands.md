# Automatic Commands

There are a few messages that Becca will automatically send when certain conditions are met.

- `Welcome Messages` - Cyberon will send a welcome message to the server when a new user joins. When you do `cyb!config` if a valid channel is provided for the welcome channel during cyberon's server config procedure, it will send a message to the channel inviting the user to introduce themselves.
- `Depart Messages` - Cyberon will send a departing message to the server when a new user leaves. When you do `cyb!config` if a valid channel is provided for the depart channel during cyberon's server config procedure.
- `Deleted Message Log` - If a valid channel is provided for during server config using `cyb!config`, Cyberon will send an embed message to that channel when someone deletes a message or edits a message. The embed will contain the deleted or edited message's author and content.
